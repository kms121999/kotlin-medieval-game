# Overview

This text-based-game is set in medieval times. You are charged with the management of a small town. Each day, you must strengthen your forces and defend against bandit raids. Once you have gained sufficient strength, you must attack the bandits to gain experience and level up.

I developed this game—which uses many common features of Kotlin including functions, classes, Collections, and other basic programming features—to gain a familiarity with the Kotlin language.

# Development Environment

* IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.2 (Community Edition)
* JDK 13.0.1
* Kotlin 1.7.20

# Future Work

* Implement town population which grows each day. Population cap should be managed by town level and number of farms.
* Population should be reduced after battle. This should be mitigated by armour.
* Implement a save/load game feature
* Game difficulty-over-time needs to be adjusted
* Building menu should show current level of buildings
* Shop menu should show current count of items
